There are two scenarios for loading dependents js files from a single main JavaScript file with two diverse loading tools.

- Client Side - **RequireJs**
- Server Side - **NodeJs**

RequieJS is an implementation of AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) specification. Instead of loading files one after the other, AMD can load them all separately, even when they are dependent on each other.
